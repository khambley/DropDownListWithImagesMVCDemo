# DropDownListWithImagesMVCDemo
This is updated version of Jeff Johnson's Adding Images to Select Lists in MVC3 except I'm using Jquery UI SelectMenu widget. 
The msdropdown plugin was abandoned 5 years ago and doesn't work with MVC 4 or greater.

Here is Jeff's old code from 2012 [jeffjohnson9046/MVC3-ImagesInSelectLists](https://github.com/jeffjohnson9046/MVC3-ImagesInSelectLists/blob/master/MVC3.ImagesInDropdownLists/Views/Contestant/Create.cshtml)
